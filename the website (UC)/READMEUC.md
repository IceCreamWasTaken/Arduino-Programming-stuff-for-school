This stuff is for UC

In particular this is the Assessment 3 work task, about Text to speech yay!

5:26pm @ Wed 25th May - Google's online tts sucks so i'm sticking with the offline one.

5:46pm @ Wed 25th May - Decided to rethink how to work around with python, but instead found out combining HTML, CSS and Javascript, you will be able to create a website styled TTS application and ITS WITHOUT PYTHON YAY. Problem is you got to Javascript!'

5:52pm @ Wed 25th May - HTML, CSS, Python instead of javascript (Server!)
learn how to build a web server (majority of learning python)
Library of tts 
Priortise Server Management 
Start for the next few weeks on setting up a web server 
Python Server
HTML, CSS content
Flask-Mega stuff! First 14 Chapters  (https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)

6:42pm - getting to it, pretty hard to do!

6:06pm @ Wed 1st June - Got a working server with html elements! 

Wed 8th June - Added paragraph tags and added some sweet sweet styles!
  - Also read the first 10 chapters, I don't think I'll be needing a login system but as I'm progressing if I do have time, I can create one for people to access their past content (text to speech inputs and download files again)

Wed 15th June - Revisited Chapter 2 and added a template to be used later in chapter 11 (making the server website look smick!)
- Also added a div header just there, dunno what to do might add something fancy when I have time for it. (it does nothing)
- Don't think I will be using Bootstrap but I did install it just incase. When I have extra time i'll see if I can make the website nice. Functionality first!
- Flagging Chapter 11 to come back to, I would like to make my website look nice with that bit of server management but I need to focus on the TTS aspect first as it's a high priority
- Skim read Chapter 12, probably going to flag this as I want to put a clock interface somehow on the website. But again probably not going to be using it
- Stopped at Chapter 13, would be interesting trying to use different languages for TTS!
